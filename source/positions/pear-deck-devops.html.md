# Devops/Supporting Engineer

We'll have multiple product teams working together on individual features, and we want to find someone to help us keep communication & collaboration between teams going smoothly. This isn't a managerial position, but a role for an engineer who enjoys helping others with tooling, and monitoring our kubernetes cluster (we use prometheus but need someone to design alarms), and helping the customer success team understand technical situations, etc. You'll work with Riley (effective CTO) and also the tech lead on each product team to set standards in coding, or deployment config patterns. During the workday you'd be the first contact to triage production issues, and afterhours you'd share pager (slack) duty.

## Prerequisites

  - Experience with dev tools, systems of distributed services, security
  - Love of invention & a willingness to be thorough
  - Honesty, determination, and humility


## Things your team might do on a given day
  - Help a product team decide on a service architecture or consider CPU requirements
  - Help customer support decide if a customer report is a bug, and figure out who will be able to fix it (maybe you)
  - Design an alert system (we use prometheus) for a particular service that you think is vulnerable to outages
  - Respond to an after-hours alert you designed
  - Mentor another engineer
  - Reflect and improve yourself, your team, and Pear Deck!



## About Working on Our Product Team

Our process is very collaborative and affords many opportunities to talk through ideas or get feedback. At the same time, individual alone time to puzzle or crank through some code is an important part of the work. Our teams are always working to find a balance between community and autonomy, spaciousness and sprinting, perfecting and shipping.

We are looking for people who are excited to bring their creativity, honesty, and initiative to the challenges of growing a company and creating something worthy.
