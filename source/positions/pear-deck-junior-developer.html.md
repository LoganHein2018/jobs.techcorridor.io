## About Working on Our Product Team

We are forming a new product pod at Pear Deck and are looking for a combination of skills spread across four new people.  Product design and development at Pear Deck is about working as a team to unpack a problem and solve it. Your team will work closely together every day to scope out new features, design them, test them, and code them.

Our process is very collaborative and affords many opportunities to talk through ideas or get feedback. At the same time, individual alone time to puzzle or crank through some code is an important part of the work. Our teams are always working to find a balance between community and autonomy, spaciousness and sprinting, perfecting and shipping.

We are looking for people who are excited to bring their creativity, honesty, and initiative to the challenges of growing a company and creating something worthy.
