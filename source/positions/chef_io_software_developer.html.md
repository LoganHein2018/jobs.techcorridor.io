# Software Developer

Chef is building the best infrastructure automation platform on the planet.
We’re writing the rules of the cloud – rules the world’s top engineers live,
breathe and contribute to. We’re some of the world’s most well-known and
respected software developers, systems architects and operations engineers, who
have built, designed and operated web applications you’re probably using right
now.

## About our team

The service layer, including the REST API, is written in Erlang and talks to a PostgreSQL database. Our web interface is written in AngularJS. We use Ruby and Chef for build automation, testing, and deployment.

You don’t need to be an expert in any of these technologies to join us; you need a strong general foundation that will allow you to ramp up quickly.

We use kanban to help us visualize our work and improve our process. Features and fixes are written as pull requests and reviewed by the team. Code review is an essential part of our process. Work is not complete unless it is tested. We encourage pair programming on production code.

If this sounds like a team you’d enjoy working with and technology you want to spend time on, for a product you can get behind, contact us!

Here are some things we are looking for in a team member:

* You like to dive in, learn new things, and want to build awesome products.
* You know more than one programming language.
* You are comfortable using command line tools for Linux system administration.
* You can demonstrate deep knowledge for some language or technology stack that you've worked with for a while.
* You’re familiar with XP practices (Pairing, Test Driven Development)
* If you’re not based in Seattle, you have experience working remotely
