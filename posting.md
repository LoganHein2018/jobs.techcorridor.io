## Post

**Thank you for your interest in adding a position or organization to this site!**  We have a growing technology community in Iowa's Technology Corridor and we'd love to help connect you.

_Please understand that this community site is maintained entirely by volunteers._  We have a vested interest in seeing our tech community grow and thrive, but our time can be limited -- though we'll do our best to review requests quickly.  (Want to lend a hand?  Get in touch in the `#admin` room on our Slack.)

### Rules

We are focused on Iowa's Technology Corridor.  Roughly speaking, this includes areas near I-380 in Iowa.  Remote jobs and organizations are welcomed, but only if the company involved _already has **at least one** employee in the area_.  Generally speaking, positions should be related to **creating** new technology.  For example, software developers, graphic designers, project managers, etc.
